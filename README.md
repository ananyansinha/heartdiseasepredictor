# Heart Disease Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes. Built using Python, trained on a public dataset, and ready for real-time predictions.

##  Dataset

This project uses the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) containing patient data like cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Optionally deployable as a Streamlit or Flask app

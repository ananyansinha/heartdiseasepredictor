# Heart Disease Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes. Built using Python, trained on a public dataset, and ready for real-time predictions. 

##  Dataset

This project uses the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) containing patient data like cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Optionally deployable as a Streamlit or Flask app

## Results

The following models were trained and evaluated on the dataset:

- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of 85.3%
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of 87.4%
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Achieved an accuracy of 86.1%

Confusion matrices and classification reports for each model are included in the Jupyter notebook.
